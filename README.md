# Sierpinski Triangle

This solution was developed using d3 svg rendering library. 

I choose svg and d3 because of the helpful built in functionality for zooming and panning.

Currently only tested in Firefox.

Future work could include
  - Use html canvas instead of svg. Limitation of svg means after 10000 nodes, performance starts to decrease dramaticaly co canvas could help improve this.
